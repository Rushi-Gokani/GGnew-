## 2. WHAT IS THE FIFTH COURSE  
**Content (Deck: Pages 3, 4)**

In every celebration, there’s a moment that stays.  
A bite that lingers.  
A feeling that returns.

That’s **The Fifth Course**.

We were born from a question:  
*What happens after you think it’s all been served?*

The Fifth Course isn’t a course on a menu —  
it’s a philosophy.

The unexpected flourish.  
The taste you didn’t see coming.  
The story you didn’t know you needed to tell.

This is not catering.  
This is a curated sensory experience.

**Layout Notes**
- Two-column layout  
- Text on left, styled dish image on right  
- Editorial spacing (no tight paragraphs)  
- Gentle parallax on image
